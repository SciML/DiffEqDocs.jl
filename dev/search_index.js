Documentation Page: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/types/dynamical_types/\n\nDynamical ordinary differential equations, such as those arising from the definition of a Hamiltonian system or a second order ODE, have a special structure that can be utilized in the solution of the differential equation. On this page, we describe how to define second order differential equations for their efficient numerical solution.\n\nMathematical Specification of a Dynamical ODE Problem\n\nThese algorithms require a Partitioned ODE of the form:\n\nfracdvdt = f_1(ut) \nfracdudt = f_2(v) \n\nThis is a Partitioned ODE partitioned into two groups, so the functions should be specified as f1(dv,v,u,p,t) and f2(du,v,u,p,t) (in the inplace form), where f1 is independent of v (unless specified by the solver), and f2 is independent of u and t. This includes discretizations arising from SecondOrderODEProblems where the velocity is not used in the acceleration function, and Hamiltonians where the potential is (or can be) time-dependent, but the kinetic energy is only dependent on v.\n\nNote that some methods assume that the integral of f2 is a quadratic form. That means that f2=v'*M*v, i.e. int f_2 = frac12 m v^2, giving du = v. This is equivalent to saying that the kinetic energy is related to v^2. The methods which require this assumption will lose accuracy if this assumption is violated. Methods listed make note of this requirement with \"Requires quadratic kinetic energy\".\n\nConstructor\n\nDynamicalODEProblem(f::DynamicalODEFunction,v0,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();kwargs...)\nDynamicalODEProblem{isinplace}(f1,f2,v0,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();kwargs...)\n\nDefines the ODE with the specified functions. isinplace optionally sets whether the function is inplace or not. This is determined automatically, but not inferred.\n\nParameters are optional, and if not given, then a NullParameters() singleton will be used which will throw nice errors if you try to index non-existent parameters. Any extra keyword arguments are passed on to the solvers. For example, if you set a callback in the problem, then that callback will be added in every solve call.\n\nFields\n\nf1 and f2: The functions in the ODE.\nv0 and u0: The initial conditions.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\np: The parameters for the problem.

In this case, you may want to use the ModelingToolkit.jl index reduction tools to improve the numerical stability of a solve. In addition, if it's a highly stiff ODE/DAE that is large, and you're using a matrix-free solver (such as GMRES), make sure the tolerance of the GMRES is well-tuned and an appropriate preconditioner is applied.

If this is a major issue for your application, you may want to write your model to be robust to this behavior, such as changing sqrt(u[i]) to sqrt(max(0,u[i])).

GPUs generally require some intensive parallel operation in the user's f function to be viable, for example, a matrix multiplication for a stencil computation in a PDE. If you're simply solving some ODE element-wise on a big array, it likely won't do much, or it will slow things down just due to how GPUs work.

This means that symplectic integrators do not experience (very much) longtime drift, but their orbit is not exactly the same as the true solution in phase space, and thus you will see differences in energy that tend to look periodic. There is a small drift which grows linearly and is related to floating-point error, but this drift is much less than standard methods.

Documentation Page: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/types/splitodetypes/\n\nMathematical Specification of a Split ODE Problem\n\nTo define a SplitODEProblem, you simply need to give two functions f_1 and f_2 along with an initial condition u_0 which define an ODE:\n\nfracdudt =  f_1(upt) + f_2(upt)\n\nf should be specified as f(u,p,t) (or in-place as f(du,u,p,t)), and u₀ should be an AbstractArray (or number) whose geometry matches the desired geometry of u. Note that we are not limited to numbers or vectors for u₀; one is allowed to provide u₀ as arbitrary matrices / higher dimension tensors as well.\n\nMany splits are at least partially linear. That is the equation:\n\nfracdudt =  Au + f_2(upt)\n\nFor how to define a linear function A, see the documentation for the AbstractSciMLOperator.\n\nConstructors\n\nSplitODEProblem(f::SplitFunction,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();kwargs...)\nSplitODEProblem{isinplace}(f1,f2,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();kwargs...)\n\nThe isinplace parameter can be omitted and will be determined using the signature of f2. Note that both f1 and f2 should support the in-place style if isinplace is true or they should both support the out-of-place style if isinplace is false. You cannot mix up the two styles.\n\nParameters are optional, and if not given, then a NullParameters() singleton will be used which will throw nice errors if you try to index non-existent parameters. Any extra keyword arguments are passed on to the solvers. For example, if you set a callback in the problem, then that callback will be added in every solve call.\n\nUnder the hood, a SplitODEProblem is just a regular ODEProblem whose f is a SplitFunction. Therefore, you can solve a SplitODEProblem using the same solvers for ODEProblem. For solvers dedicated to split problems, see Split ODE Solvers.\n\nFor specifying Jacobians and mass matrices, see the DiffEqFunctions page.\n\nFields\n\nf1, f2: The functions in the ODE.\nu0: The initial condition.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\np: The parameters for the problem.

For all cases, u0 is the initial condition, p are the parameters, and t is the independent variable.\n\nGenerally, for ODE integrators the f_1 portion should be considered the \"stiff portion of the model\" with larger timescale separation, while the f_2 portion should be considered the \"non-stiff portion\".

The cost of this operation is highly dependent on the sparsity pattern.\n\nNote on the Derivative Definition\n\nThe derivatives, such as the Jacobian, are only defined on the f1 portion of the split ODE.

Documentation Page: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/types/sdde_types/\n\nMathematical Specification of a Stochastic Delay Differential Equation (SDDE) Problem\n\nTo define a SDDE Problem, you simply need to give the drift function f, the diffusion function g, the initial condition u_0 at time point t_0, and the history function h which together define a SDDE:\n\ndu = f(uhpt)dt + g(uhpt)dW_t qquad (t geq t_0)\n\nu(t_0) = u_0\n\nu(t) = h(t) qquad (t  t_0)\n\nf should be specified as f(u, h, p, t) (or in-place as f(du, u, h, p, t)) (and g should match). u_0 should be an AbstractArray (or number) whose geometry matches the desired geometry of u, and h should be specified as described below. The history function h is accessed for all delayed values. Note that we are not limited to numbers or vectors for u_0; one is allowed to provide u_0 as arbitrary matrices / higher dimension tensors as well.\n\nNote that this functionality should be considered experimental.\n\nFunctional Forms of the History Function\n\nThe history function h can be called in the following ways:\n\nh(p, t): out-of-place calculation\nh(out, p, t): in-place calculation\nh(p, t, deriv::Type{Val{i}}): out-of-place calculation of the ith derivative\nh(out, p, t, deriv::Type{Val{i}}): in-place calculation of the ith derivative\nh(args...; idxs): calculation of h(args...) for indices idxs\n\nNote that a dispatch for the supplied history function of matching form is required for whichever function forms are used in the user derivative function f.\n\nDeclaring Lags\n\nLags are declared separately from their use. One can use any lag by simply using the interpolant of h at that point. However, one should use caution in order to achieve the best accuracy. When lags are declared, the solvers can more efficiently be more accurate and thus this is recommended.\n\nNeutral, Retarded, and Algebraic Stochastic Delay Differential Equations\n\nNote that the history function specification can be used to specify general retarded arguments, i.e. h(p,α(u,t)). Neutral delay differential equations can be specified by using the deriv value in the history interpolation. For example, h(p,t-τ, Val{1}) returns the first derivative of the history values at time t-τ.\n\nNote that algebraic equations can be specified by using a singular mass matrix.\n\nProblem Type\n\nConstructors\n\nSDDEProblem(f,g[, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\nSDDEProblem{isinplace,specialize}(f,g[, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\n\nisinplace optionally sets whether the function is inplace or not. This is determined automatically, but not inferred. specialize optionally controls the specialization level. See the specialization levels section of the SciMLBase documentation for more details. The default is `AutoSpecialize.\n\nFor more details on the in-place and specialization controls, see the ODEFunction documentation.\n\nParameters are optional, and if not given, then a NullParameters() singleton will be used which will throw nice errors if you try to index non-existent parameters. Any extra keyword arguments are passed on to the solvers. For example, if you set a callback in the problem, then that callback will be added in every solve call.\n\nFor specifying Jacobians and mass matrices, see the DiffEqFunctions page.\n\nArguments\n\nf: The drift function in the SDDE.\ng: The diffusion function in the SDDE.\nu0: The initial condition.

A callback is initiated if the condition hits 0 within the time interval. See the Integrator Interface documentation for information about integrator.\naffect!: This is the function affect!(integrator) where one is allowed to modify the current state of the integrator. If you do not pass an affect_neg! function, it is called when condition is found to be 0 (at a root) and the cross is either an upcrossing (from negative to positive) or a downcrossing (from positive to negative). You need to explicitly pass nothing as the affect_neg! argument if it should only be called at upcrossings, e.g. ContinuousCallback(condition, affect!, nothing). For more information on what can be done, see the Integrator Interface manual page. Modifications to u are safe in this function.\naffect_neg!=affect!: This is the function affect_neg!(integrator) where one is allowed to modify the current state of the integrator. This is called when condition is found to be 0 (at a root) and the cross is a downcrossing (from positive to negative). For more information on what can be done, see the Integrator Interface manual page. Modifications to u are safe in this function.\nrootfind=LeftRootFind: This is a flag to specify the type of rootfinding to do for finding event location. If this is set to LeftRootfind, the solution will be backtracked to the point where condition==0 and if the solution isn't exact, the left limit of root is used. If set to RightRootFind, the solution would be set to the right limit of the root. Otherwise, the systems and the affect! will occur at t+dt. Note that these enums are not exported, and thus one needs to reference them as SciMLBase.LeftRootFind, SciMLBase.RightRootFind, or SciMLBase.NoRootFind.\ninterp_points=10: The number of interpolated points to check the condition. The condition is found by checking whether any interpolation point / endpoint has a different sign. If interp_points=0, then conditions will only be noticed if the sign of condition is different at t than at t+dt. This behavior is not robust when the solution is oscillatory, and thus it's recommended that one use some interpolation points (they're cheap to compute!). 0 within the time interval.\nsave_positions=(true,true): Boolean tuple for whether to save before and after the affect!. This saving will occur just before and after the event, only at event times, and does not depend on options like saveat, save_everystep, etc. (i.e. if saveat=[1.0,2.0,3.0], this can still add a save point at 2.1 if true). For discontinuous changes like a modification to u to be handled correctly (without error), one should set save_positions=(true,true).\nidxs=nothing: The components which will be interpolated into the condition. Defaults to nothing which means u will be all components.\ninitialize: This is a function (c,u,t,integrator) which can be used to initialize the state of the callback c. It should modify the argument c and the return is ignored.\nfinalize: This is a function (c,u,t,integrator) which can be used to finalize the state of the callback c. It can modify the argument c and the return is ignored.\nabstol=1e-14 & reltol=0: These are used to specify a tolerance from zero for the rootfinder: if the starting condition is less than the tolerance from zero, then no root will be detected. This is to stop repeat events happening immediately after a rootfinding event.\nrepeat_nudge = 1//100: This is used to set the next testing point after a previously found zero. Defaults to 1//100, which means after a callback, the next sign check will take place at t + dt*1//100 instead of at t to avoid repeats.\ninitializealg = nothing: In the context of a DAE, this is the algorithm that is used to run initialization after the effect. The default of nothing defers to the initialization algorithm provided in the solve.\n\nwarn: Warn\nThe effect of using a callback with a DAE needs to be done with care because the solution u needs to satisfy the algebraic constraints before taking the next step. For this reason, a consistent initialization calculation must be run after running the callback.

For example, if you set a callback in the problem, then that callback will be added in every solve call.\n\nFields\n\nf: The function for the ODE.\nbc: The boundary condition function.\nu0: The initial condition. Either the initial condition for the ODE as an initial value problem, or a Vector of values for u(t_i) for collocation methods.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\np: The parameters for the problem. Defaults to NullParameters\nkwargs: The keyword arguments passed onto the solves.\n\nSpecial Keyword Arguments\n\nnlls: Specify that the BVP is a nonlinear least squares problem. Use Val(true) or Val(false) for type stability. By default this is automatically inferred based on the size of the input and outputs, however this is type unstable for any array type that doesn't store array size as part of type information. If we can't reliably infer this, we set it to Nothing. Downstreams solvers must be setup to deal with this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"types/bvp_types/#Solution-Type","page":"BVP Problems","title":"Solution Type","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"types/bvp_types/","page":"BVP Problems","title":"BVP Problems","text":"BVProblem solutions return an ODESolution.

By default, alg = nothing. If alg = nothing, then solve dispatches to the DifferentialEquations.jl automated algorithm selection (if using DifferentialEquations was done, otherwise it will error with a MethodError).\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\nThe DifferentialEquations.jl universe has a large set of common arguments available for the solve function. These arguments apply to solve on any problem type and are only limited by limitations of the specific implementations.\n\nMany of the defaults depend on the algorithm or the package the algorithm derives from. Not all of the interface is provided by every algorithm. For more detailed information on the defaults and the available options for specific algorithms / packages, see the manual pages for the solvers of specific problems. To see whether a specific package is compatible with the use of a given option, see the Solver Compatibility Chart\n\nDefault Algorithm Hinting\n\nTo help choose the default algorithm, the keyword argument alg_hints is provided to solve. alg_hints is a Vector{Symbol} which describe the problem at a high level to the solver. The options are:\n\n:auto vs :nonstiff vs :stiff - Denotes the equation as nonstiff/stiff. :auto allow the default handling algorithm to choose stiffness detection algorithms. The default handling defaults to using :auto.\n\nCurrently unused options include:\n\n:interpolant - Denotes that a high-precision interpolation is important.\n:memorybound - Denotes that the solver will be memory bound.\n\nThis functionality is derived via the benchmarks in SciMLBenchmarks.jl\n\nSDE Specific Alghints\n\n:additive - Denotes that the underlying SDE has additive noise.\n:stratonovich - Denotes that the solution should adhere to the Stratonovich interpretation.\n\nOutput Control\n\nThese arguments control the output behavior of the solvers. It defaults to maximum output to give the best interactive user experience, but can be reduced all the way to only saving the solution at the final timepoint.\n\nThe following options are all related to output control. See the \"Examples\" section at the end of this page for some example usage.\n\ndense: Denotes whether to save the extra pieces required for dense (continuous) output. Default is save_everystep && isempty(saveat) for algorithms which have the ability to produce dense output, i.e. by default it's true unless the user has turned off saving on steps or has chosen a saveat value. If dense=false, the solution still acts like a function, and sol(t) is a linear interpolation between the saved time points.\nsaveat: Denotes specific times to save the solution at, during the solving phase. The solver will save at each of the timepoints in this array in the most efficient manner available to the solver. If only saveat is given, then the arguments save_everystep and dense are false by default. If saveat is given a number, then it will automatically expand to tspan[1]:saveat:tspan[2]. For methods where interpolation is not possible, saveat may be equivalent to tstops. The default value is [].\nsave_idxs: Denotes the indices for the components of the equation to save. Defaults to saving all indices. For example, if you are solving a 3-dimensional ODE, and given save_idxs = [1, 3], only the first and third components of the solution will be outputted. Notice that of course in this case the outputted solution will be two-dimensional.\ntstops: Denotes extra times that the timestepping algorithm must step to. This should be used to help the solver deal with discontinuities and singularities, since stepping exactly at the time of the discontinuity will improve accuracy. If a method cannot change timesteps (fixed timestep multistep methods), then tstops will use an interpolation, matching the behavior of saveat. If a method cannot change timesteps and also cannot interpolate, then tstops must be a multiple of dt or else an error will be thrown. Default is [].\nd_discontinuities: Denotes locations of discontinuities in low order derivatives. This will force FSAL algorithms which assume derivative continuity to re-evaluate the derivatives at the point of discontinuity. The default is [].\nsave_everystep: Saves the result at every step. Default is true if isempty(saveat).\nsave_on: Denotes whether intermediate solutions are saved. This overrides the settings of dense, saveat and save_everystep and is used by some applications to manually turn off saving temporarily. Everyday use of the solvers should leave this unchanged. Defaults to true.\nsave_start: Denotes whether the initial condition should be included in the solution type as the first timepoint. Defaults to true.\nsave_end: Denotes whether the final timepoint is forced to be saved, regardless of the other saving settings. Defaults to true.\ninitialize_save: Denotes whether to save after the callback initialization phase (when u_modified=true). Defaults to true.\n\nNote that dense requires save_everystep=true and saveat=false. If you need additional saving while keeping dense output, see the SavingCallback in the Callback Library.\n\nStepsize Control\n\nThese arguments control the timestepping routines.\n\nBasic Stepsize Control\n\nThese are the standard options for controlling stepping behavior. Error estimates do the comparison\n\nerr_scaled = err(abstol + max(uprevu)*reltol)\n\nThe scaled error is guaranteed to be <1 for a given local error estimate (note: error estimates are local unless the method specifies otherwise). abstol controls the non-scaling error and thus can be thought of as the error around zero. reltol scales with the size of the dependent variables and so one can interpret reltol=1e-3 as roughly being (locally) correct to 3 digits. Note tolerances can be specified element-wise by passing a vector whose size matches u0.\n\nadaptive: Turns on adaptive timestepping for appropriate methods. Default is true.\nabstol: Absolute tolerance in adaptive timestepping. This is the tolerance on local error estimates, not necessarily the global error (though these quantities are related). Defaults to 1e-6 on deterministic equations (ODEs/DDEs/DAEs) and 1e-2 on stochastic equations (SDEs/RODEs).\nreltol: Relative tolerance in adaptive timestepping.  This is the tolerance on local error estimates, not necessarily the global error (though these quantities are related). Defaults to 1e-3 on deterministic equations (ODEs/DDEs/DAEs) and 1e-2 on stochastic equations (SDEs/RODEs).\ndt: Sets the initial stepsize. This is also the stepsize for fixed timestep methods. Defaults to an automatic choice if the method is adaptive.\ndtmax: Maximum dt for adaptive timestepping. Defaults are package-dependent.\ndtmin: Minimum dt for adaptive timestepping. Defaults are package-dependent.\nforce_dtmin: Declares whether to continue, forcing the minimum dt usage. Default is false, which has the solver throw a warning and exit early when encountering the minimum dt. Setting this true allows the solver to continue, never letting dt go below dtmin (and ignoring error tolerances in those cases). Note that true is not compatible with most interop packages.\n\nFixed Stepsize Usage\n\nNote that if a method does not have adaptivity, the following rules apply:\n\nIf dt is set, then the algorithm will step with size dt each iteration.\nIf tstops and dt are both set, then the algorithm will step with either a size dt, or use a smaller step to hit the tstops point.\nIf tstops is set without dt, then the algorithm will step directly to each value in tstops\nIf neither dt nor tstops are set, the solver will throw an error.\n\nAdvanced Adaptive Stepsize Control\n\nThese arguments control more advanced parts of the internals of adaptive timestepping and are mostly used to make it more efficient on specific problems. For detailed explanations of the timestepping algorithms, see the timestepping descriptions\n\ninternalnorm: The norm function internalnorm(u,t) which error estimates are calculated. Required are two dispatches: one dispatch for the state variable and the other on the elements of the state variable (scalar norm). Defaults are package-dependent.\ncontroller: Possible examples are IController, PIController, PIDController, PredictiveController. Default is algorithm-dependent.\ngamma: The risk-factor γ in the q equation for adaptive timestepping of the controllers using it. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nbeta1: The Lund stabilization α parameter. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nbeta2: The Lund stabilization β parameter. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nqmax: Defines the maximum value possible for the adaptive q. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nqmin: Defines the minimum value possible for the adaptive q. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nqsteady_min: Defines the minimum for the range around 1 where the timestep is held constant. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nqsteady_max: Defines the maximum for the range around 1 where the timestep is held constant. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nqoldinit: The initial qold in stabilization stepping. Default is algorithm-dependent.\nfailfactor: The amount to decrease the timestep by if the Newton iterations of an implicit method fail. Default is 2.\n\nMemory Optimizations\n\ncalck: Turns on and off the internal ability for intermediate interpolations (also known as intermediate density). Not the same as dense, which is post-solution interpolation. This defaults to dense || !isempty(saveat) ||  \"no custom callback is given\". This can be used to turn off interpolations (to save memory) if one isn't using interpolations when a custom callback is used. Another case where this may be used is to turn on interpolations for usage in the integrator interface even when interpolations are used nowhere else. Note that this is only required if the algorithm doesn't have a free or lazy interpolation (DP8()). If calck = false, saveat cannot be used. The rare keyword calck can be useful in event handling.\nalias_u0: allows the solver to alias the initial condition array that is contained in the problem struct. Defaults to false.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nmaxiters: Maximum number of iterations before stopping. Defaults to 1e5.\ncallback: Specifies a callback. Defaults to a callback function which performs the saving routine. For more information, see the Event Handling and Callback Functions manual page.\nisoutofdomain: Specifies a function isoutofdomain(u,p,t) where, when it returns true, it will reject the timestep. Disabled by default.\nunstable_check: Specifies a function unstable_check(dt,u,p,t) where, when it returns true, it will cause the solver to exit and throw a warning. Defaults to any(isnan,u), i.e. checking if any value is a NaN.\nverbose: Toggles whether warnings are thrown when the solver exits early. Defaults to true.\nmerge_callbacks: Toggles whether to merge prob.callback with the solve keyword argument callback. Defaults to true.\nwrap: Toggles whether to wrap the solution if prob.problem_type has a preferred alternate wrapper type for the solution. Useful when speed, but not shape of solution is important. Defaults to Val(true). Val(false) will cancel wrapping the solution.\nu0: The initial condition, overrides the one defined in the problem struct. Defaults to nothing (no override, use the u0 defined in prob).\np: The parameters, overrides the one defined in the problem struct. Defaults to nothing (no override, use the p defined in prob).\n\nProgress Monitoring\n\nThese arguments control the usage of the progressbar in ProgressLogging.jl compatible environments.\n\nprogress: Turns on/off the Juno progressbar. Default is false.\nprogress_steps: Numbers of steps between updates of the progress bar. Default is 1000.\nprogress_name: Controls the name of the progressbar. Default is the name of the problem type.\nprogress_message: Controls the message with the progressbar. Defaults to showing dt, t, the maximum of u.\nprogress_id: Controls the ID of the progress log message to distinguish simultaneous simulations.\n\nError Calculations\n\nIf you are using the test problems (ex: ODETestProblem), then the following options control the errors which are calculated:\n\ntimeseries_errors: Turns on and off the calculation of errors at the steps which were taken, such as the l2 error. Default is true.\ndense_errors: Turns on and off the calculation of errors at the steps which require dense output and calculate the error at 100 evenly-spaced points throughout tspan. An example is the L2 error. Default is false.\n\nSensitivity Algorithms (sensealg)\n\nsensealg is used for choosing the way the automatic differentiation is performed. For more information, see the documentation for SciMLSensitivity: https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLSensitivity/stable/\n\nExamples\n\nThe following lines are examples of how one could use the configuration of solve(). For these examples a 3-dimensional ODE problem is assumed, however the extension to other types is straightforward.\n\nsolve(prob, AlgorithmName()) : The \"default\" setting, with a user-specified\n\nalgorithm (given by AlgorithmName()). All parameters get their default values.

Documentation Page: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/types/dde_types/\n\nMathematical Specification of a DDE Problem\n\nTo define a DDE Problem, you simply need to give the function f, the initial condition u_0 at time point t_0, and the history function h which together define a DDE:\n\nfracdudt = f(uhpt) qquad (t geq t_0)\n\nu(t_0) = u_0\n\nu(t) = h(t) qquad (t  t_0)\n\nf should be specified as f(u, h, p, t) (or in-place as f(du, u, h, p, t)), u_0 should be an AbstractArray (or number) whose geometry matches the desired geometry of u, and h should be specified as described below. The history function h is accessed for all delayed values. Note that we are not limited to numbers or vectors for u_0; one is allowed to provide u_0 as arbitrary matrices / higher dimension tensors as well.\n\nFunctional Forms of the History Function\n\nThe history function h can be called in the following ways:\n\nh(p, t): out-of-place calculation\nh(out, p, t): in-place calculation\nh(p, t, deriv::Type{Val{i}}): out-of-place calculation of the ith derivative\nh(out, p, t, deriv::Type{Val{i}}): in-place calculation of the ith derivative\nh(args...; idxs): calculation of h(args...) for indices idxs\n\nNote that a dispatch for the supplied history function of matching form is required for whichever function forms are used in the user derivative function f.\n\nDeclaring Lags\n\nLags are declared separately from their use. One can use any lag by simply using the interpolant of h at that point. However, one should use caution in order to achieve the best accuracy. When lags are declared, the solvers can be more efficient and accurate, and this is thus recommended.\n\nNeutral and Retarded Delay Differential Equations\n\nNote that the history function specification can be used to specify general retarded arguments, i.e. h(p,α(u,t)). Neutral delay differential equations can be specified by using the deriv value in the history interpolation. For example, h(p,t-τ, Val{1}) returns the first derivative of the history values at time t-τ.\n\nNote that algebraic equations can be specified by using a singular mass matrix.\n\nProblem Type\n\nConstructors\n\nDDEProblem(f[, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\nDDEProblem{isinplace,specialize}(f[, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\n\nisinplace optionally sets whether the function is inplace or not. This is determined automatically, but not inferred. specialize optionally controls the specialization level. See the specialization levels section of the SciMLBase documentation for more details. The default is AutoSpecialize.\n\nFor more details on the in-place and specialization controls, see the ODEFunction documentation.\n\nParameters are optional, and if not given, then a NullParameters() singleton will be used which will throw nice errors if you try to index non-existent parameters. Any extra keyword arguments are passed on to the solvers. For example, if you set a callback in the problem, then that callback will be added in every solve call.\n\nFor specifying Jacobians and mass matrices, see the DiffEqFunctions page.\n\nArguments\n\nf: The function in the DDE.\nu0: The initial condition. Defaults to the value h(p, first(tspan)) of the history function evaluated at the initial time point.\nh: The history function for the DDE before t0.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\np: The parameters with which function f is called. Defaults to NullParameters.\nconstant_lags: A collection of constant lags used by the history function h. Defaults to ().\ndependent_lags A tuple of functions (u, p, t) -> lag for the state-dependent lags used by the history function h. Defaults to ().\nneutral: If the DDE is neutral, i.e., if delays appear in derivative terms.\norder_discontinuity_t0: The order of the discontinuity at the initial time point. Defaults to 0 if an initial condition u0 is provided. Otherwise, it is forced to be greater or equal than 1.\nkwargs: The keyword arguments passed onto the solves.\n\nDynamical Delay Differential Equations\n\nMuch like Dynamical ODEs, a Dynamical DDE is a Partitioned DDE of the form:\n\nfracdvdt = f_1(uth) \nfracdudt = f_2(vh) \n\nConstructors\n\nDynamicalDDEProblem(f1, f2[, v0, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\nDynamicalDDEProblem{isinplace}(f1, f2[, v0, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\n\nParameter isinplace optionally sets whether the function is inplace or not. This is determined automatically, but not inferred.\n\nArguments\n\nf: The function in the DDE.\nv0 and u0: The initial condition. Defaults to the values h(p, first(tspan))... of the history function evaluated at the initial time point.\nh: The history function for the DDE before t0. Must return an object with the indices 1 and 2, with the values of v and u respectively.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\np: The parameters with which function f is called. Defaults to NullParameters.\nconstant_lags: A collection of constant lags used by the history function h. Defaults to ().\ndependent_lags A tuple of functions (v, u, p, t) -> lag for the state-dependent lags used by the history function h. Defaults to ().\nneutral: If the DDE is neutral, i.e., if delays appear in derivative terms.\norder_discontinuity_t0: The order of the discontinuity at the initial time point. Defaults to 0 if an initial condition u0 is provided. Otherwise, it is forced to be greater or equal than 1.\nkwargs: The keyword arguments passed onto the solves.\n\nFor dynamical and second order DDEs, the history function will return an object with the indices 1 and 2 defined, where h(p, t_prev)[1] is the value of f_2(v u h p t_mathrmprev) and h(p, t_prev)[2] is the value of f_1(v u h p t_mathrmprev) (this is for consistency with the ordering of the initial conditions in the constructor). The supplied history function must also return such a 2-index object, which can be accomplished with a tuple (v,u) or vector [v,u].\n\n2nd Order Delay Differential Equations\n\nTo define a 2nd Order DDE Problem, you simply need to give the function f and the initial condition u_0 which define an DDE:\n\nu = f(uuhpt)\n\nf should be specified as f(du,u,p,t) (or in-place as f(ddu,du,u,p,t)), and u₀ should be an AbstractArray (or number) whose geometry matches the desired geometry of u. Note that we are not limited to numbers or vectors for u₀; one is allowed to provide u₀ as arbitrary matrices / higher dimension tensors as well.\n\nFrom this form, a dynamical ODE:\n\nv = f(vuhpt) \nu = v \n\nConstructors\n\nSecondOrderDDEProblem(f, [, du0, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\nSecondOrderDDEProblem{isinplace}(f, [, du0, u0], h, tspan[, p]; <keyword arguments>)\n\nParameter isinplace optionally sets whether the function is inplace or not. This is determined automatically, but not inferred.\n\nArguments\n\nf: The function in the DDE.\ndu0 and u0: The initial condition. Defaults to the values h(p, first(tspan))... of the history function evaluated at the initial time point.\nh: The history function for the DDE before t0. Must return an object with the indices 1 and 2, with the values of v and u respectively.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\np: The parameters with which function f is called. Defaults to NullParameters.\nconstant_lags: A collection of constant lags used by the history function h. Defaults to ().\ndependent_lags A tuple of functions (v, u, p, t) -> lag for the state-dependent lags used by the history function h. Defaults to ().\nneutral: If the DDE is neutral, i.e., if delays appear in derivative terms.\norder_discontinuity_t0: The order of the discontinuity at the initial time point. Defaults to 0 if an initial condition u0 is provided. Otherwise, it is forced to be greater or equal than 1.\nkwargs: The keyword arguments passed onto the solves.\n\nAs above, the history function will return an object with indices 1 and 2, with the values of du and u respectively. The supplied history function must also match this return type, e.g. by returning a 2-element tuple or vector.\n\nExample Problems\n\nExample problems can be found in DiffEqProblemLibrary.jl.\n\nTo use a sample problem, such as prob_dde_constant_1delay_ip, you can do something like:\n\n#] add DDEProblemLibrary\nusing DDEProblemLibrary\nprob = DDEProblemLibrary.prob_dde_constant_1delay_ip\nsol = solve(prob)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"types/dde_types/#SciMLBase.DDEFunction","page":"DDE Problems","title":"SciMLBase.DDEFunction","text":"DocStringExtensions.TypeDefinition()\n\nA representation of a DDE function f, defined by:\n\nM fracdudt = f(uhpt)\n\nand all of its related functions, such as the Jacobian of f, its gradient with respect to time, and more.

This function should be given as f!(du,u,h,p,t) or du = f(u,h,p,t). See the section on iip for more details on in-place vs out-of-place handling. The history function h acts as an interpolator over time, i.e. h(t) with options matching the solution interface, i.e. h(t; save_idxs = 2).\n\nAll of the remaining functions are optional for improving or accelerating the usage of f. These include:\n\nmass_matrix: the mass matrix M represented in the ODE function. Can be used to determine that the equation is actually a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) if M is singular. Note that in this case special solvers are required, see the DAE solver page for more details: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/.

Generally only used for testing and development of the solvers.\ntgrad(dT,u,h,p,t) or dT=tgrad(u,p,t): returns fracpartial f(upt)partial t\njac(J,u,h,p,t) or J=jac(u,p,t): returns fracdfdu\njvp(Jv,v,h,u,p,t) or Jv=jvp(v,u,p,t): returns the directional derivativefracdfdu v\nvjp(Jv,v,h,u,p,t) or Jv=vjp(v,u,p,t): returns the adjoint derivativefracdfdu^ast v\njac_prototype: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the Jacobian. For example, if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized Tridiagonal matrix can be used as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured sparsity patterns should use a SparseMatrixCSC with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian. The default is nothing, which means a dense Jacobian.\nparamjac(pJ,h,u,p,t): returns the parameter Jacobian fracdfdp.\ncolorvec: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity pattern of the jac_prototype. This specializes the Jacobian construction when using finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner based on the sparsity pattern. Defaults to nothing, which means a color vector will be internally computed on demand when required. The cost of this operation is highly dependent on the sparsity pattern.\n\niip: In-Place vs Out-Of-Place\n\nFor more details on this argument, see the ODEFunction documentation.\n\nspecialize: Controlling Compilation and Specialization\n\nFor more details on this argument, see the ODEFunction documentation.\n\nFields\n\nThe fields of the DDEFunction type directly match the names of the inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"types/dde_types/#Solution-Type","page":"DDE Problems","title":"Solution Type","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"types/dde_types/","page":"DDE Problems","title":"DDE Problems","text":"DDEProblem solutions return an ODESolution.

To simulate the TMS we need to incorporate three more dimensions, u, R, gsyn into our system. u decays towards 0, R decays towards 1 and gsyn decays towards 0 as it did with the alpha synapse. The crucial part of the TMS is in epsp!, where we handle the discontinuities when a synaptic event occurs. Instead of just setting gsyn to the maximum conductance gmax, we increment gsyn by a fraction of gmax that depends on the other two dynamic parameters.

The Jacobian is the matrix fracdf_idr_j, where r is read by the linear index (i.e. down columns). But since the u variables depend on the v, the band size here is large, and thus this will not do well with a Banded Jacobian solver. Instead, we utilize sparse Jacobian algorithms. CVODE_BDF allows us to use a sparse Newton-Krylov solver by setting linear_solver = :GMRES.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/faster_ode_example/","page":"Code Optimization for Differential Equations","title":"Code Optimization for Differential Equations","text":"note: Note\nThe Solving Large Stiff Equations tutorial goes through these details.

Documentation Page: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/types/dae_types/\n\nMathematical Specification of an DAE Problem\n\nTo define a DAE Problem, you simply need to give the function f and the initial condition u_0 which define an ODE:\n\n0 = f(duupt)\n\nf should be specified as f(du,u,p,t) (or in-place as f(resid,du,u,p,t)). Note that we are not limited to numbers or vectors for u₀; one is allowed to provide u₀ as arbitrary matrices / higher dimension tensors as well.\n\nProblem Type\n\nConstructors\n\nDAEProblem(f::DAEFunction,du0,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();kwargs...)\nDAEProblem{isinplace,specialize}(f,du0,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();kwargs...) : Defines the DAE with the specified functions. isinplace optionally sets whether the function is inplace or not. This is determined automatically, but not inferred. specialize optionally controls the specialization level. See the specialization levels section of the documentation for more details. The default is AutoSpecialize.\n\nFor more details on the in-place and specialization controls, see the ODEFunction documentation.\n\nParameters are optional, and if not given, then a NullParameters() singleton will be used which will throw nice errors if you try to index non-existent parameters. Any extra keyword arguments are passed on to the solvers. For example, if you set a callback in the problem, then that callback will be added in every solve call.\n\nFor specifying Jacobians and mass matrices, see the DiffEqFunctions page.\n\nFields\n\nf: The function in the ODE.\ndu0: The initial condition for the derivative.\nu0: The initial condition.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\ndifferential_vars: A logical array which declares which variables are the differential (non-algebraic) vars (i.e. du' is in the equations for this variable). Defaults to nothing. Some solvers may require this be set if an initial condition needs to be determined.\np: The parameters for the problem. Defaults to NullParameters\nkwargs: The keyword arguments passed onto the solves.\n\nExample Problems\n\nExamples problems can be found in DiffEqProblemLibrary.jl.\n\nTo use a sample problem, such as prob_dae_resrob, you can do something like:\n\n#] add DAEProblemLibrary\nusing DAEProblemLibrary\nprob = DAEProblemLibrary.prob_dae_resrob\nsol = solve(prob,IDA())\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"types/dae_types/#SciMLBase.DAEFunction","page":"DAE Problems","title":"SciMLBase.DAEFunction","text":"DocStringExtensions.TypeDefinition()\n\nA representation of an implicit DAE function f, defined by:\n\n0 = f(fracdudtupt)\n\nand all of its related functions, such as the Jacobian of f, its gradient with respect to time, and more.

For example, if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized Tridiagonal matrix can be used as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured sparsity patterns should use a SparseMatrixCSC with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian. The default is nothing, which means a dense Jacobian.\ncolorvec: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity pattern of the jac_prototype. This specializes the Jacobian construction when using finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner based on the sparsity pattern.

Documentation Page: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/types/sde_types/\n\nMathematical Specification of a SDE Problem\n\nTo define an SDE Problem, you simply need to give the forcing function f, the noise function g, and the initial condition u₀ which define an SDE:\n\ndu = f(upt)dt + Σgᵢ(upt)dWⁱ\n\nf and g should be specified as f(u,p,t) and  g(u,p,t) respectively, and u₀ should be an AbstractArray whose geometry matches the desired geometry of u. Note that we are not limited to numbers or vectors for u₀; one is allowed to provide u₀ as arbitrary matrices / higher dimension tensors as well. A vector of gs can also be defined to determine an SDE of higher Ito dimension.\n\nProblem Type\n\nWraps the data which defines an SDE problem\n\nu = f(upt)dt + Σgᵢ(upt)dWⁱ\n\nwith initial condition u0.\n\nConstructors\n\nSDEProblem(f::SDEFunction,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();noise=WHITE_NOISE,noise_rate_prototype=nothing)\nSDEProblem{isinplace,specialize}(f,g,u0,tspan,p=NullParameters();noise=WHITE_NOISE,noise_rate_prototype=nothing) : Defines the SDE with the specified functions. The default noise is WHITE_NOISE. isinplace optionally sets whether the function is inplace or not. This is determined automatically, but not inferred. specialize optionally controls the specialization level. See the specialization levels section of the SciMLBase documentation for more details. The default is `AutoSpecialize.\n\nParameters are optional, and if not given then a NullParameters() singleton will be used which will throw nice errors if you try to index non-existent parameters. Any extra keyword arguments are passed on to the solvers. For example, if you set a callback in the problem, then that callback will be added in every solve call.\n\nFor specifying Jacobians and mass matrices, see the DiffEqFunctions page.\n\nFields\n\nf: The drift function in the SDE.\ng: The noise function in the SDE.\nu0: The initial condition.\ntspan: The timespan for the problem.\np: The optional parameters for the problem. Defaults to NullParameters.\nnoise: The noise process applied to the noise upon generation. Defaults to Gaussian white noise. For information on defining different noise processes, see the noise process documentation page.\nnoise_rate_prototype: A prototype type instance for the noise rates, that is the output g. It can be any type which overloads A_mul_B! with itself being the middle argument. Commonly, this is a matrix or sparse matrix. If this is not given, it defaults to nothing, which means the problem should be interpreted as having diagonal noise.\nkwargs: The keyword arguments passed onto the solves.\n\nExample Problems\n\nExamples problems can be found in DiffEqProblemLibrary.jl.\n\nTo use a sample problem, such as prob_sde_linear, you can do something like:\n\n#] add SDEProblemLibrary\nusing SDEProblemLibrary\nprob = SDEProblemLibrary.prob_sde_linear\nsol = solve(prob)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"types/sde_types/#SciMLBase.SDEFunction","page":"SDE Problems","title":"SciMLBase.SDEFunction","text":"DocStringExtensions.TypeDefinition()\n\nA representation of an SDE function f, defined by:\n\nM du = f(upt)dt + g(upt) dW\n\nand all of its related functions, such as the Jacobian of f, its gradient with respect to time, and more.

See the section on iip for more details on in-place vs out-of-place handling.\n\nAll of the remaining functions are optional for improving or accelerating the usage of f. These include:\n\nmass_matrix: the mass matrix M represented in the ODE function. Can be used to determine that the equation is actually a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) if M is singular. Note that in this case special solvers are required, see the DAE solver page for more details: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/.

For example, if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized Tridiagonal matrix can be used as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured sparsity patterns should use a SparseMatrixCSC with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian. The default is nothing, which means a dense Jacobian.\nparamjac(pJ,u,p,t): returns the parameter Jacobian fracdfdp.\ncolorvec: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity pattern of the jac_prototype. This specializes the Jacobian construction when using finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner based on the sparsity pattern.

SciML provides many explicit and implicit solvers suited for different types of ODE problems. It is possible to reduce a system of partial differential equations into an ODE problem by employing the method of lines (MOL). The essence of MOL is to discretize the spatial derivatives (by finite difference, finite volume or finite element methods) into algebraic equations and to keep the time derivatives as is. The resulting differential equations are left with only one independent variable (time) and can be solved with an ODE solver. Solving Systems of Stochastic PDEs and using GPUs in Julia is a brief introduction to MOL and using GPUs to accelerate PDE solving in JuliaDiffEq.

It includes options for both direct and iterative (Krylov) methods for the solution of the linear systems arising at each (implicit) time step. DASKR is a variant of the DASPK package [1].  In addition to all the capabilities of DASPK, DASKR includes the ability to find the roots of a given set of functions while integrating the DAE system.\n\nIn contrast to the older DASSL package, DASKR includes a procedure for calculating consistent initial conditions for a large class of problems (which includes semi-explicit index-1 systems) [2].  This procedure includes options for inequality constraints on selected components.  The package also includes an option to omit the algebraic components from the local error control.\n\nLinear Solver Choice\n\nChoices for the linear solver are:\n\n:Dense\n:Banded\n:SPIGMR, a Krylov method\n\nOther Keyword Arguments\n\njac_upper=0,jac_lower=0: used for setting the upper and lower bands for a banded Jacobian. Defaults to 0. Ignored unless the linear solver is :Banded.\nmax_order = 5: the maximum order of the BDF method.\nnon_negativity_enforcement = 0, whether to enforce non-negativty in the solution. Defaults to 0 or false, can be set to 1 to enable.\nnon_negativity_enforcement_array = nothing, an array of 0's and 1's for specifying non-negativity enforcement to a subset of states.\nmax_krylov_iters=nothing: maximum number of iterations for the Krylov subspace linear solver before rejecting a step. Defaults to nothing or an automatic detection.\nnum_krylov_vectors=nothing: maximum number of history states in the GMRES vector. Defaults to nothing or an automatic choice\nmax_number_krylov_restarts=5: If you figure out what this is, open an issue or PR.\nkrylov_convergence_test_constant = 0.05: Some constant in DASKR's convergence test.\nexclude_algebraic_errors = false: whether algebraic variables are included in the adaptive time stepping error check.

Note that in this case special solvers are required, see the DAE solver page for more details: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/. Must be an AbstractArray or an AbstractSciMLOperator.\nanalytic(u0,p,t): used to pass an analytical solution function for the analytical solution of the ODE.

For example, if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized Tridiagonal matrix can be used as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured sparsity patterns should use a SparseMatrixCSC with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian. The default is nothing, which means a dense Jacobian.\nparamjac(pJ,u,p,t): returns the parameter Jacobian fracdfdp.\ncolorvec: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity pattern of the jac_prototype. This specializes the Jacobian construction when using finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner based on the sparsity pattern. Defaults to nothing, which means a color vector will be internally computed on demand when required. The cost of this operation is highly dependent on the sparsity pattern.\n\niip: In-Place vs Out-Of-Place\n\niip is the optional boolean for determining whether a given function is written to be used in-place or out-of-place. In-place functions are f!(du,u,p,t) where the return is ignored, and the result is expected to be mutated into the value of du. Out-of-place functions are du=f(u,p,t).\n\nNormally, this is determined automatically by looking at the method table for f and seeing the maximum number of arguments in available dispatches. For this reason, the constructor ODEFunction(f) generally works (but is type-unstable). However, for type-stability or to enforce correctness, this option is passed via ODEFunction{true}(f).\n\nspecialize: Controlling Compilation and Specialization\n\nThe specialize parameter controls the specialization level of the ODEFunction on the function f. This allows for a trade-off between compile and run time performance. The available specialization levels are:\n\nSciMLBase.AutoSpecialize: this form performs a lazy function wrapping on the functions of the ODE in order to stop recompilation of the ODE solver, but allow for the prob.f to stay unwrapped for normal usage. This is the default specialization level and strikes a balance in compile time vs runtime performance.\nSciMLBase.FullSpecialize: this form fully specializes the ODEFunction on the constituent functions that make its fields. As such, each ODEFunction in this form is uniquely typed, requiring re-specialization and compilation for each new ODE definition. This form has the highest compile-time at the cost of being the most optimal in runtime. This form should be preferred for long-running calculations (such as within optimization loops) and for benchmarking.\nSciMLBase.NoSpecialize: this form fully unspecializes the function types in the ODEFunction definition by using an Any type declaration. As a result, it can result in reduced runtime performance, but is the form that induces the least compile-time.\nSciMLBase.FunctionWrapperSpecialize: this is an eager function wrapping form. It is unsafe with many solvers, and thus is mostly used for development testing.\n\nFor more details, see the specialization levels section of the SciMLBase documentation.\n\nFields\n\nThe fields of the ODEFunction type directly match the names of the inputs.\n\nMore Details on Jacobians\n\nThe following example creates an inplace ODEFunction whose Jacobian is a Diagonal:\n\nusing LinearAlgebra\nf = (du,u,p,t) -> du .= t .* u\njac = (J,u,p,t) -> (J[1,1] = t; J[2,2] = t; J)\njp = Diagonal(zeros(2))\nfun = ODEFunction(f; jac=jac, jac_prototype=jp)\n\nNote that the integrators will always make a deep copy of fun.jac_prototype, so there's no worry of aliasing.\n\nIn general, the Jacobian prototype can be anything that has mul! defined, in particular sparse matrices or custom lazy types that support mul!. A special case is when the jac_prototype is a AbstractSciMLOperator, in which case you do not need to supply jac as it is automatically set to update_coefficients!. Refer to the AbstractSciMLOperators documentation for more information on setting up time/parameter dependent operators.\n\nExamples\n\nDeclaring Explicit Jacobians for ODEs\n\nThe most standard case, declaring a function for a Jacobian is done by overloading the function f(du,u,p,t) with an in-place updating function for the Jacobian: f_jac(J,u,p,t) where the value type is used for dispatch. For example, take the Lotka-Volterra model:\n\nfunction f(du,u,p,t)\n  du[1] = 2.0 * u[1] - 1.2 * u[1]*u[2]\n  du[2] = -3 * u[2] + u[1]*u[2]\nend\n\nTo declare the Jacobian, we simply add the dispatch:\n\nfunction f_jac(J,u,p,t)\n  J[1,1] = 2.0 - 1.2 * u[2]\n  J[1,2] = -1.2 * u[1]\n  J[2,1] = 1 * u[2]\n  J[2,2] = -3 + u[1]\n  nothing\nend\n\nThen we can supply the Jacobian with our ODE as:\n\nff = ODEFunction(f;jac=f_jac)\n\nand use this in an ODEProblem:\n\nprob = ODEProblem(ff,ones(2),(0.0,10.0))\n\nSymbolically Generating the Functions\n\nSee the modelingtoolkitize function from ModelingToolkit.jl for automatically symbolically generating the Jacobian and more from the numerically-defined functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"types/ode_types/#Solution-Type","page":"ODE Problems","title":"Solution Type","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"types/ode_types/","page":"ODE Problems","title":"ODE Problems","text":"SciMLBase.ODESolution","category":"page"},{"location":"types/ode_types/#SciMLBase.ODESolution","page":"ODE Problems","title":"SciMLBase.ODESolution","text":"struct ODESolution{T, N, uType, uType2, DType, tType, rateType, discType, P, A, IType, S, AC<:Union{Nothing, Vector{Int64}}, R, O} <: SciMLBase.AbstractODESolution{T, N, uType}\n\nRepresentation of the solution to an ordinary differential equation defined by an ODEProblem.\n\nDESolution Interface\n\nFor more information on interacting with DESolution types, check out the Solution Handling page of the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation.\n\nhttps://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/solution/\n\nFields\n\nu: the representation of the ODE solution.
