For high order Runge-Kutta methods it's likely lower than the Sundials estimate because of more operations packed into each internal step, but as always that will need more benchmarks to be precise and will depend on the problem being solved. GPUs generally require some intensive parallel operation in the user's f function to be viable, for example a matrix multiplication for a stencil computation in a PDE. If you're simply solving some ODE element-wise on a big array it likely won't do much or it will slow things down just due to how GPUs work. DistributedArrays require parallel linear solves to really matter, and thus are only recommended when you have a problem that cannot fit into memory or are using a stiff solver with a Krylov method for the linear solves.","category":"page"},{"location":"basics/faq/#My-ODE-is-solving-really-slow-1","page":"Frequently Asked Questions","title":"My ODE is solving really slow","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"basics/faq/#","page":"Frequently Asked Questions","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","text":"First, check for bugs.

The condition is found by checking whether any interpolation point / endpoint has a different sign. If interp_points=0, then conditions will only be noticed if the sign of condition is different at t than at t+dt. This behavior is not robust when the solution is oscillatory, and thus it's recommended that one use some interpolation points (they're cheap to compute!). 0 within the time interval.\nsave_positions=(true,true): Boolean tuple for whether to save before and after the affect!.

For discontinuous changes like a modification to u to be handled correctly (without error), one should set save_positions=(true,true).\nidxs=nothing: The components which will be interpolated into the condition.
