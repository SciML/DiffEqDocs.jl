# [DASKR.jl](@id daskr)

This is a wrapper package for importing solvers from DASKR into the SciML interface.
DASKR.jl is not automatically included by DifferentialEquations.jl. To use this
algorithm, you will need to install and use the package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DASKR")
import DASKR
```

These methods can be used independently of the rest of DifferentialEquations.jl.
