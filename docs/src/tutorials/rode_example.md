# [Random Ordinary Differential Equations](@id rode_example)

!!! note
    
    This tutorial assumes you have read the [Ordinary Differential Equations tutorial](@ref ode_example).

## Example 1: Scalar RODEs

In this example, we will solve the equation

```math
du = f(u,p,t,W)dt
```

where ``f(u,p,t,W)=2u\sin(W)`` and ``W(t)`` is a Wiener process (Gaussian process).

```@example rode
using DifferentialEquations
using Plots
function f3(u, p, t, W)
    2u * sin(W)
end
u0 = 1.00
tspan = (0.0, 5.0)
prob = RODEProblem(f3, u0, tspan)
sol = solve(prob, RandomEM(), dt = 1 / 100)
plot(sol)
```

The random process defaults to a Gaussian/Wiener process, so there is nothing
else required here! See the documentation on
[`NoiseProcess`es](@ref noise_process) for details on how to define
other noise processes.

## Example 2: Systems of RODEs

As with the other problem types, there is an in-place version which is more
efficient for systems. The signature is `f(du,u,p,t,W)`. For example,

```@example rode2
using DifferentialEquations
using Plots
function f(du, u, p, t, W)
    du[1] = 2u[1] * sin(W[1] - W[2])
    du[2] = -2u[2] * cos(W[1] + W[2])
end
u0 = [1.00; 1.00]
tspan = (0.0, 5.0)
prob = RODEProblem(f, u0, tspan)
sol = solve(prob, RandomEM(), dt = 1 / 100)
plot(sol)
```

By default, the size of the noise process matches the size of `u0`. However,
you can use the `rand_prototype` keyword to explicitly set the size of the
random process:

```@example rode3
using DifferentialEquations
using Plots
function f(du, u, p, t, W)
    du[1] = -2W[3] * u[1] * sin(W[1] - W[2])
    du[2] = -2u[2] * cos(W[1] + W[2])
end
u0 = [1.00; 1.00]
tspan = (0.0, 5.0)
prob = RODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, rand_prototype = zeros(3))
sol = solve(prob, RandomEM(), dt = 1 / 100)
plot(sol)
```
