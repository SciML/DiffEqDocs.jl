# [Event Handling and Callback Functions](@id callbacks)

DifferentialEquations.jl allows for using callback functions to inject user code
into the solver algorithms. It allows for safely and accurately applying events
and discontinuities. Multiple callbacks can be chained together, and these callback
types can be used to build libraries of extension behavior.

## The Callback Types

The callback types are defined as follows. There are three primitive callback types: the `ContinuousCallback`, `DiscreteCallback` and the `VectorContinuousCallback`:

  - The [`ContinuousCallback`](@ref) is applied when a given continuous *condition function* hits zero. This hitting can happen even within
    an integration step, and the solver must be able to detect it and adjust the integration step accordingly. This type of callback implements
    what is known in other problem-solving environments as an *Event*.
  - The [`DiscreteCallback`](@ref) is applied when its *condition function* is `true`, but the condition is only evaluated at the end of every
    integration step.
  - The [`VectorContinuousCallback`](@ref) works like a vector of `ContinuousCallbacks` and lets the user specify a vector of continuous callbacks,
    each with simultaneous rootfinding equations. The effect that is applied is the effect corresponding to the first (earliest) condition that is
    satisfied. A `VectorContinuousCallback` is more efficient than a `CallbackSet` of `ContinuousCallback`s as the number of callbacks grows. As
    such, it's a slightly more involved definition which gives better scaling.

## Using Callbacks

The callback type is then sent to the solver (or the integrator) via the `callback`
keyword argument:

```julia
sol = solve(prob, alg, callback = cb)
```

You can supply `nothing`, a single `DiscreteCallback` or `ContinuousCallback` or `VectorContinuousCallback`,
or a `CallbackSet`.

### Note About Saving

When a callback is supplied, the default saving behavior is turned off. This is
because otherwise, events would “double save” one of the values. To re-enable
the standard saving behavior, one must have the first `save_positions` value
be true for at least one callback.

### Modifying the Stepping Within A Callback

A common issue with callbacks is that they cause a large discontinuous change,
and so it may be wise to pull down `dt` after such a change. To control the
timestepping from a callback, please see [the timestepping controls in the integrator interface](@ref stepping_controls). Specifically, `set_proposed_dt!` is used to set the next stepsize,
and `terminate!` can be used to cause the simulation to stop.

## DiscreteCallback Examples

### Example 1: Interventions at Preset Times

Assume we have a patient whose internal drug concentration follows exponential decay, i.e. the linear ODE with
a negative coefficient:

```@example callback1
import DifferentialEquations as DE
function f(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = -u[1]
end
u0 = [10.0]
const V = 1
prob = DE.ODEProblem(f, u0, (0.0, 10.0))
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5())
import Plots;
Plots.plot(sol);
```

Now assume we wish to give the patient a dose of 10 at time `t==4`. For this,
we can use a `DiscreteCallback` which will only be true at `t==4`:

```@example callback1
condition(u, t, integrator) = t == 4
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10
cb = DE.DiscreteCallback(condition, affect!)
```

If we then solve with this callback enabled, we see no change:

```@example callback1
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

The reason there is no change is because the `DiscreteCallback` only applies at
a specific time, and the integrator never hit that time. Thus we would like to
force the ODE solver to step exactly at `t=4` so that the condition can be applied.
We can do that with the `tstops` argument:

```@example callback1
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb, tstops = [4.0])
Plots.plot(sol)
```

and thus we achieve the desired result.

Performing multiple doses then just requires that we have multiple points which
are hit. For example, to dose at time `t=4` and `t=8`, we can do the following:

```@example callback1
dosetimes = [4.0, 8.0]
condition(u, t, integrator) = t ∈ dosetimes
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10
cb = DE.DiscreteCallback(condition, affect!)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb, tstops = dosetimes)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

We can then use this mechanism to make the model arbitrarily complex. For
example, let's say there's now 3 dose times, but the dose only triggers if the
current concentration is below 1.0. Additionally, the dose is now `10t` instead
of just `10`. This model is implemented as simply:

```@example callback1
dosetimes = [4.0, 6.0, 8.0]
condition(u, t, integrator) = t ∈ dosetimes && (u[1] < 1.0)
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10 * integrator.t
cb = DE.DiscreteCallback(condition, affect!)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb, tstops = dosetimes)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

#### PresetTimeCallback

Because events at preset times is a very common occurrence,
DifferentialEquations.jl provides a pre-built callback in the [Callback Library](@ref callback_library).
The `PresetTimeCallback(tstops,affect!)` takes an array of times and an `affect!`
function to apply. Thus to do the simple 2 dose example with this callback, we
could do the following:

```@example callback1
dosetimes = [4.0, 8.0]
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10
cb = DE.PresetTimeCallback(dosetimes, affect!)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

Notice that this version will automatically set the `tstops` for you.

### Example 2: A Control Problem

Another example of a `DiscreteCallback` is a control problem switching
parameters. Our parameterized ODE system is as follows:

Our ODE function will use this field as follows:

```@example callback2
function f(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = -0.5 * u[1] + p
    du[2] = -0.5 * u[2]
end
```

Now we will setup our control mechanism. It will be a simple setup which uses
set timepoints at which we will change `p`. At `t=5.0` we will want to increase
the value of `p`, and at `t=8.0` we will want to decrease the value of `p`. Using
the [`DiscreteCallback` interface](@ref discrete_callback), we code these conditions
as follows:

```@example callback2
const tstop1 = [5.0]
const tstop2 = [8.0]

function condition(u, t, integrator)
    t in tstop1
end

function condition2(u, t, integrator)
    t in tstop2
end
```

Now we have to apply an effect when these conditions are reached. When `condition`
is hit (at `t=5.0`), we will increase `p` to 1.5. When `condition2` is reached,
we will decrease `p` to `-1.5`. This is done via the functions:

```@example callback2
function affect!(integrator)
    integrator.p = 1.5
end

function affect2!(integrator)
    integrator.p = -1.5
end
```

With these functions we can build our callbacks:

```@example callback2
import DifferentialEquations as DE
save_positions = (true, true)

cb = DE.DiscreteCallback(condition, affect!, save_positions = save_positions)

save_positions = (false, true)

cb2 = DE.DiscreteCallback(condition2, affect2!, save_positions = save_positions)

cbs = DE.CallbackSet(cb, cb2)
```

Now we define our initial condition. We will start at `[10.0;10.0]` with `p=0.0`.

```@example callback2
u0 = [10.0; 10.0]
p = 0.0
prob = DE.ODEProblem(f, u0, (0.0, 10.0), p)
```

Lastly we solve the problem. Note that we must pass `tstop` values of `5.0` and
`8.0` to ensure the solver hits those timepoints exactly:

```@example callback2
const tstop = [5.0; 8.0]
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cbs, tstops = tstop)
import Plots;
Plots.plot(sol);
```

It's clear from the plot how the controls affected the outcome.

### Example 3: AutoAbstol

MATLAB's Simulink has the option for [an automatic absolute tolerance](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/gui/absolutetolerance.html).
In this example we will implement a callback which will add this behavior to
any JuliaDiffEq solver which implements the `integrator` and callback interface.

The algorithm is as follows. The default value is set to start at `1e-6`, though
we will give the user an option for this choice. Then as the simulation progresses,
at each step the absolute tolerance is set to the maximum value that has been
reached so far times the relative tolerance. This is the behavior that we will
implement in `affect!`.

Since the effect is supposed to occur every timestep, we use the trivial condition:

```@example callback3
condition = function (u, t, integrator)
    true
end
```

which always returns true. For our effect we will overload the call on a type.
This type will have a value for the current maximum. By doing it this way, we
can store the current state for the running maximum. The code is as follows:

```@example callback3
mutable struct AutoAbstolAffect{T}
    curmax::T
end
# Now make `affect!` for this:
function (p::AutoAbstolAffect)(integrator)
    p.curmax = max(p.curmax, integrator.u)
    integrator.opts.abstol = p.curmax * integrator.opts.reltol
    DE.u_modified!(integrator, false)
end
```

This makes `affect!(integrator)` use an internal mutating value `curmax` to update
the absolute tolerance of the integrator as the algorithm states.

Lastly, we can wrap it in a nice little constructor:

```@example callback3
function AutoAbstol(save = true; init_curmax = 1e-6)
    affect! = AutoAbstolAffect(init_curmax)
    condition = (u, t, integrator) -> true
    save_positions = (save, false)
    DE.DiscreteCallback(condition, affect!, save_positions = save_positions)
end
```

This creates the `DiscreteCallback` from the `affect!` and `condition` functions
that we implemented. Now

```@example callback3
import DifferentialEquations as DE
cb = AutoAbstol(true; init_curmax = 1e-6)
```

returns the callback that we created. We can then solve an equation using this
by simply passing it with the `callback` keyword argument. Using the integrator
interface rather than the solve interface, we can step through one by one
to watch the absolute tolerance increase:

```@example callback3
function g(u, p, t)
    -u[1]
end
u0 = 10.0
const V = 1
prob = DE.ODEProblem(g, u0, (0.0, 10.0))
integrator = DE.init(prob, DE.BS3(), callback = cb)
at1 = integrator.opts.abstol
DE.step!(integrator)
at2 = integrator.opts.abstol
at1 <= at2
```

```@example callback3
DE.step!(integrator)
at3 = integrator.opts.abstol
at2 <= at3
```

Note that this example is contained in the [Callback Library](@ref callback_library),
a library of useful callbacks for JuliaDiffEq solvers.

## ContinuousCallback Examples

### Example 1: Bouncing Ball

Let's look at the bouncing ball. Let the first variable `y` is the height which
changes by `v` the velocity, where the velocity is always changing at `-g` which
is the gravitational constant. This is the equation:

```@example callback4
function f(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = u[2]
    du[2] = -p
end
```

All we have to do in order to specify the event is to have a function which
should always be positive, with an event occurring at 0.
We thus want to check if the ball's height ever hits zero:

```@example callback4
function condition(u, t, integrator) # Event when condition(u,t,integrator) == 0
    u[1]
end
```

Notice that here we used the values `u` instead of the value from the `integrator`.
This is because the values `u,t` will be appropriately modified at the interpolation
points, allowing for the rootfinding behavior to occur.

Now we have to say what to do when the event occurs. In this case, we just
flip the velocity (the second variable)

```@example callback4
function affect!(integrator)
    integrator.u[2] = -integrator.u[2]
end
```

The callback is thus specified by:

```@example callback4
import DifferentialEquations as DE
cb = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, affect!)
```

Then you can solve and plot:

```@example callback4
u0 = [50.0, 0.0]
tspan = (0.0, 15.0)
p = 9.8
prob = DE.ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb)
import Plots;
Plots.plot(sol);
```

As you can see from the resulting image, DifferentialEquations.jl is smart enough
to use the interpolation to hone in on the time of the event and apply the event
back at the correct time. Thus, one does not have to worry about the adaptive timestepping
“overshooting” the event, as this is handled for you. Notice that the event macro
will save the value(s) at the discontinuity.

The callback is robust to having multiple discontinuities occur. For example,
we can integrate for long time periods and get the desired behavior:

```@example callback4
u0 = [50.0, 0.0]
tspan = (0.0, 100.0)
prob = DE.ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

#### Handling Changing Dynamics and Exactness

Let's make a version of the bouncing ball where the ball sticks to the ground.
We can do this by introducing a parameter `p` to send the velocity to zero on
the bounce. This looks as follows:

```@example callback4
function dynamics!(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = u[2]
    du[2] = p[1] * -9.8
end
function floor_aff!(int)
    int.p[1] = 0
    int.u[2] = 0
    @show int.u[1], int.t
end
floor_event = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, floor_aff!)
u0 = [1.0, 0.0]
p = [1.0]
prob = DE.ODEProblem{true}(dynamics!, u0, (0.0, 1.75), p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = floor_event)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

Notice that at the end, the ball is not at `0.0` like the condition would let
you believe, but instead it's at `4.329177480185359e-16`. From the printing
inside the affect function, we can see that this is the value it had at the
event time `t=0.4517539514526232`. Why did the event handling not make it exactly
zero? If you instead had run the simulation to
`nextfloat(0.4517539514526232) = 0.45175395145262326`, we would see that the
value of `u[1] = -1.2647055847076505e-15`. You can see this by changing the
`rootfind` argument of the callback:

```@example callback4
floor_event = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, floor_aff!, rootfind = DE.SciMLBase.RightRootFind)
u0 = [1.0, 0.0]
p = [1.0]
prob = DE.ODEProblem{true}(dynamics!, u0, (0.0, 1.75), p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = floor_event)
sol[end] # [-1.2647055847076505e-15, 0.0]
```

What this means is that there is no 64-bit floating-point number `t` such that
the condition is zero! By default, if there is no `t` such that `condition=0`,
then the rootfinder defaults to choosing the floating-point number exactly before
the event (`LeftRootFind`). This way manifold constraints are
preserved by default (i.e. the ball never goes below the floor). However, if you
require that the condition is exactly satisfied after the event, you will want
to add such a change to the `affect!` function. For example, the error correction
in this case is to add `int.u[1] = 0` to the `affect!`, i.e.:

```@example callback4
function floor_aff!(int)
    int.p[1] = 0
    int.u[1] = 0
    int.u[2] = 0
    @show int.u[1], int.t
end
floor_event = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, floor_aff!)
u0 = [1.0, 0.0]
p = [1.0]
prob = DE.ODEProblem{true}(dynamics!, u0, (0.0, 1.75), p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = floor_event)
sol[end] # [0.0,0.0]
```

and now the sticky behavior is perfect to the floating-point.

#### Handling Accumulation Points

Now let's take a look at the bouncing ball with friction. After the bounce,
we will send the velocity to `-v/2`. Since the velocity is halving each time,
we should have Zeno-like behavior and see an accumulation point of bounces. We
will use some extra parameters to count the number of bounces (to infinity) and
find the accumulation point. Let's watch!

```@example callback4
function dynamics!(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = u[2]
    du[2] = -9.8
end
function floor_aff!(int)
    int.u[2] *= -0.5
    int.p[1] += 1
    int.p[2] = int.t
end
floor_event = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, floor_aff!)
u0 = [1.0, 0.0]
p = [0.0, 0.0]
prob = DE.ODEProblem{true}(dynamics!, u0, (0.0, 2.0), p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = floor_event)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

From the readout, we can see the ball only bounced 8 times before it went below
the floor, what happened? What happened is floating-point error. Because one
cannot guarantee that floating-point numbers exist to make the `condition=0`,
a heuristic is used to ensure that a zero is not accidentally detected at
`nextfloat(t)` after the simulation restarts (otherwise it would repeatedly find
the same event!). However, sooner or later, the ability to detect minute floating
point differences will crash, and what should be infinitely many bounces finally
misses a bounce.

This leads to two questions:

 1. How can you improve the accuracy of an accumulation calculation?
 2. How can you make it gracefully continue?

For (1), note that floating-point accuracy is dependent on the current `dt`. If
you know that an accumulation point is coming, one can use `set_proposed_dt!`
to shrink the `dt` value and help find the next bounce point. You can use
`t - tprev` to know the length of the previous interval for this calculation.
For this example, we can set the proposed `dt` to `(t - tprev)/10` to ensure
an ever-increasing accuracy of the check.

However, at some point we will hit machine epsilon, the value where
`t + eps(t) == t`, so we cannot measure infinitely many bounces and instead will
be limited by the floating-point accuracy of our number representation. Using
alternative number types like
[ArbNumerics.jl](https://github.com/JeffreySarnoff/ArbNumerics.jl) can allow for this
to be done at very high accuracy, but still not infinite. Thus, what we need to
do is determine a tolerance after which we assume the accumulation has been
reached and define the exit behavior. In this case, we will say when the
`dt<1e-12`, we are almost at the edge of Float64 accuracy
(`eps(1.0) = 2.220446049250313e-16`), so we will change the position and
velocity to exactly zero.

With these floating-point corrections in mind, the accumulation calculation
looks as follows:

```@example callback4
function dynamics!(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = u[2]
    du[2] = p[1] * -9.8
end
function floor_aff!(int)
    int.u[2] *= -0.5
    if int.dt > 1e-12
        DE.set_proposed_dt!(int, (int.t - int.tprev) / 100)
    else
        int.u[1] = 0
        int.u[2] = 0
        int.p[1] = 0
    end
    int.p[2] += 1
    int.p[3] = int.t
end
floor_event = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, floor_aff!)
u0 = [1.0, 0.0]
p = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
prob = DE.ODEProblem{true}(dynamics!, u0, (0.0, 2.0), p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = floor_event)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

With this corrected version, we see that after 41 bounces, the accumulation
point is reached at `t = 1.355261854357056`. To really see the accumulation,
let's zoom in:

```@example callback4
p1 = Plots.plot(sol, idxs = 1, tspan = (1.25, 1.40))
p2 = Plots.plot(sol, idxs = 1, tspan = (1.35, 1.36))
p3 = Plots.plot(sol, idxs = 1, tspan = (1.354, 1.35526))
p4 = Plots.plot(sol, idxs = 1, tspan = (1.35526, 1.35526185))
Plots.plot(p1, p2, p3, p4)
```

I think Zeno would be proud of our solution.

### Example 2: Terminating an Integration

Often, you might want to terminate an integration when some condition is
satisfied. To terminate an integration, use `terminate!(integrator)` as the `affect!`
in a callback.

In this example, we will solve the differential equation:

```@example callback4
import DifferentialEquations as DE
u0 = [1.0, 0.0]
function fun2(du, u, p, t)
    du[2] = -u[1]
    du[1] = u[2]
end
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)
prob = DE.ODEProblem(fun2, u0, tspan)
```

which has cosine and -sine as the solutions respectively. We wish to solve until
the sine part, `u[2]` becomes positive. There are two things we may be looking for.

A `DiscreteCallback` will cause this to halt at the first step such that the condition
is satisfied. For example, we could use:

```@example callback4
condition(u, t, integrator) = u[2] > 0
affect!(integrator) = DE.terminate!(integrator)
cb = DE.DiscreteCallback(condition, affect!)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb)
```

However, we often wish to halt exactly at the point of time that the
condition is satisfied. To achieve that, we use a continuous callback. The condition
must thus be a function which is zero at the point we want to halt. Thus, we
use the following:

```@example callback4
condition(u, t, integrator) = u[2]
affect!(integrator) = DE.terminate!(integrator)
cb = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, affect!)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb)
import Plots;
Plots.plot(sol);
```

Note that this uses rootfinding to approximate the “exact” moment of the crossing.
Analytically we know the value is `pi`, and here the integration terminates at

```@example callback4
sol.t[end] # 3.1415902502224307
```

Using a more accurate integration increases the accuracy of this prediction:

```@example callback4
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Vern8(), callback = cb, reltol = 1e-12, abstol = 1e-12)
#π = 3.141592653589703...
sol.t[end] # 3.1415926535896035
```

Now say we wish to find when the first period is over, i.e. we want to ignore
the upcrossing and only stop on the downcrossing. We do this by ignoring the
`affect!` and only passing an `affect!` for the second:

```@example callback4
condition(u, t, integrator) = u[2]
affect!(integrator) = DE.terminate!(integrator)
cb = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, nothing, affect!)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb)
Plots.plot(sol)
```

Notice that passing only one `affect!` is the same as
`ContinuousCallback(condition,affect!,affect!)`, i.e. both upcrossings and
downcrossings will activate the event. Using
`ContinuousCallback(condition,affect!,nothing)`will thus be the same as above
because the first event is an upcrossing.

### Example 3: Growing Cell Population

Another interesting issue is with models of changing sizes. The ability to handle
such events is a unique feature of DifferentialEquations.jl! The problem we would
like to tackle here is a cell population. We start with 1 cell with a protein `X`
which increases linearly with time with rate parameter `α`. Since we will
be changing the size of the population, we write the model in the general form:

```@example callback5
const α = 0.3
function f(du, u, p, t)
    for i in 1:length(u)
        du[i] = α * u[i]
    end
end
```

Our model is that, whenever the protein `X` gets to a concentration of 1, it
triggers a cell division. So we check to see if any concentrations hit 1:

```@example callback5
function condition(u, t, integrator) # Event when condition(u,t,integrator) == 0
    1 - maximum(u)
end
```

Again, recall that this function finds events as when `condition==0`,
so `1-maximum(u)` is positive until a cell has a concentration of `X` which is
1, which then triggers the event. At the event, we have that the cell splits
into two cells, giving a random amount of protein to each one. We can do this
by resizing the cache (adding 1 to the length of all of the caches) and setting
the values of these two cells at the time of the event:

```@example callback5
function affect!(integrator)
    u = integrator.u
    maxidx = findmax(u)[2]
    DE.resize!(integrator, length(u) + 1)
    Θ = rand()
    u[maxidx] = Θ
    u[end] = 1 - Θ
    nothing
end
```

As noted in the [Integrator Interface](@ref integrator), `resize!(integrator,length(integrator.u)+1)`
is used to change the length of all of the internal caches (which includes `u`)
to be their current length + 1, growing the ODE system. Then the following code
sets the new protein concentrations. Now we can solve:

```@example callback5
import DifferentialEquations as DE
callback = DE.ContinuousCallback(condition, affect!)
u0 = [0.2]
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)
prob = DE.ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan)
sol = DE.solve(prob, callback = callback)
```

The plot recipes do not have a way of handling the changing size, but we can
plot from the solution object directly. For example, let's make a plot of how
many cells there are at each time. Since these are discrete values, we calculate
and plot them directly:

```@example callback5
import Plots
Plots.plot(sol.t, map((x) -> length(x), sol[:]), lw = 3,
    ylabel = "Number of Cells", xlabel = "Time")
```

Now let's check in on a cell. We can still use the interpolation to get a nice
plot of the concentration of cell 1 over time. This is done with the command:

```@example callback5
ts = range(0, stop = 10, length = 100)
Plots.plot(ts, map((x) -> x[1], sol.(ts)), lw = 3,
    ylabel = "Amount of X in Cell 1", xlabel = "Time")
```

Notice that every time it hits 1 the cell divides, giving cell 1 a random amount
of `X` which then grows until the next division.

Note that one macro which was not shown in this example is `deleteat!` on the caches.
For example, to delete the second cell, we could use:

```julia
DE.deleteat!(integrator, 2)
```

This allows you to build sophisticated models of populations with births and deaths.

## VectorContinuousCallback Example

### Example 1: Bouncing Ball with multiple walls

This is similar to the above Bouncing Ball example, but now we have two more vertical walls, at `x = 0` and `x = 10.0`. We have our ODEFunction as -

```@example callback6
function f(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = u[2]
    du[2] = -p
    du[3] = u[4]
    du[4] = 0.0
end
```

where `u[1]` denotes `y`-coordinate, `u[2]` denotes velocity in `y`-direction, `u[3]` denotes `x`-coordinate and `u[4]` denotes velocity in `x`-direction. We will make a `VectorContinuousCallback` of length 2 - one for `x` axis collision, one for walls parallel to `y` axis.

```@example callback6
function condition(out, u, t, integrator) # Event when condition(out,u,t,integrator) == 0
    out[1] = u[1]
    out[2] = (u[3] - 10.0)u[3]
end

function affect!(integrator, idx)
    if idx == 1
        integrator.u[2] = -0.9integrator.u[2]
    elseif idx == 2
        integrator.u[4] = -0.9integrator.u[4]
    end
end
import DifferentialEquations as DE
cb = DE.VectorContinuousCallback(condition, affect!, 2)
```

It is evident that `out[2]` will be zero when `u[3]` (x-coordinate) is either `0.0` or `10.0`. And when that happens, we flip the velocity with some coefficient of restitution (`0.9`).

Completing the rest of the code

```@example callback6
u0 = [50.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0]
tspan = (0.0, 15.0)
p = 9.8
prob = DE.ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)
sol = DE.solve(prob, DE.Tsit5(), callback = cb, dt = 1e-3, adaptive = false)
import Plots;
Plots.plot(sol, idxs = (1, 3));
```
