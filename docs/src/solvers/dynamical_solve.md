# Dynamical, Hamiltonian, and 2nd Order ODE Solvers

Dynamical ODEs, such as those arising from Hamiltonians or second
order ordinary differential equations, give rise to a special structure
that can be specialized on in the solver for more efficiency.
These algorithms require an ODE defined in the following ways:

```julia
DynamicalODEProblem{isinplace}(f1, f2, v0, u0, tspan, p = NullParameters(); kwargs...)
SecondOrderODEProblem{isinplace}(f, du0, u0, tspan, p = NullParameters(); kwargs...)
HamiltonianProblem{T}(H, p0, q0, tspan, p = NullParameters(); kwargs...)
```

These correspond to partitioned equations of motion:

```math
\frac{dv}{dt} = f_1(t,u) \\
\frac{du}{dt} = f_2(v) \\
```

or, for `SecondOrderODEProblem`,

```math
\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = f(u,p,t)
```

The functions should be specified as `f1(dv,v,u,p,t)` and `f2(du,v,u,p,t)`
(in the inplace form), where `f1` is independent of `v` (unless
specified by the solver), and `f2` is independent of `t` and `u`. This includes
discretizations arising from `SecondOrderODEProblem`s where the velocity is not
used in the acceleration function, and Hamiltonians where the potential is
(or can be) time-dependent, but the kinetic energy is only dependent on `v`.

Note that some methods assume that the integral of `f2` is a quadratic form. That
means that `f2=v'*M*v`, i.e. ``\int f_2 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2``, giving `du = v`. This is
equivalent to saying that the kinetic energy is related to ``v^2``. The methods
which require this assumption will lose accuracy if this assumption is violated.
Methods listed below make note of this requirement with "Requires quadratic
kinetic energy".

## Recommendations

When energy conservation is required, use a symplectic method. Otherwise, the
Runge-Kutta-Nyström methods will be more efficient. Energy is mostly conserved
by Runge-Kutta-Nyström methods, but is not conserved for long-time integrations.
Thus, it is suggested that for shorter integrations you use Runge-Kutta-Nyström
methods as well.

As a go-to method for efficiency, `DPRKN6` is a good choice. `DPRKN12` is a good
choice when high accuracy, like `tol<1e-10` is necessary. However, `DPRKN6` is
the only Runge-Kutta-Nyström method with a higher order interpolant (all default
to order 3 Hermite, whereas `DPRKN6` is order 6th interpolant) and thus in cases
where interpolation matters (ex: event handling) one should use `DPRKN6`. For
very smooth problems with expensive acceleration function evaluations, `IRKN4`
can be a good choice as it minimizes the number of evaluations.

For symplectic methods, higher order algorithms are the most efficient when higher
accuracy is needed, and when less accuracy is needed lower order methods do better.
Optimized efficiency methods take more steps and thus have more force calculations
for the same order, but have smaller error. Thus, the “optimized efficiency”
algorithms are recommended if your force calculation is not too sufficiency large,
while the other methods are recommended when force calculations are really large
(for example, like in MD simulations `VelocityVerlet` is very popular since it only
requires one force calculation per timestep). A good go-to method would be `McAte5`,
and a good high order choice is `KahanLi8`.

## Standard ODE Integrators

The standard ODE integrators will work on Dynamical ODE problems via an automatic
transformation to a first-order ODE. See the [ODE solvers](@ref ode_solve)
page for more details.

## Specialized OrdinaryDiffEq.jl Integrators

Unless otherwise specified, the OrdinaryDiffEq algorithms all come with a
3rd order Hermite polynomial interpolation. The algorithms denoted as having a
“free” interpolation means that no extra steps are required for the
interpolation. For the non-free higher order interpolating functions, the extra
steps are computed lazily (i.e. not during the solve).
